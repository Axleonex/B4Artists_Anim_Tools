# --- BREAKDOWN TOOLS ---
"""Help entries for breakdown analysis and visualization features.

Every breakdown tool feature gets one :class:`HelpEntry`. Categories follow the
sidebar panel layout in the UI so the Help Browser groups
match what animators see in the sidebar.

Entries use ``phase="phase3"`` to participate in the existing bulk
teardown via :func:`unregister_phase_help`.
